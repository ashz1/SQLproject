<h1>SQL CRUD App Demo</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve created a simple CRUD SQL demo app using SQLite3 to demonstrate SQL queries. This data is based on my experience as a business and data analyst in India, although it has been significantly altered for demonstration purposes.</p>

<h2>App Overview</h2>
<p>The app, built using Python’s Streamlit library, allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on two datasets: one from Flipkart and one from Amazon. It provides an interactive interface for viewing, searching, updating, and deleting data, along with the SQL queries used.</p>
